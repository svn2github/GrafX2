-------------------------------------

GrafX2 is a drawing program dedicated to pixelart and low-color graphics.
This program is dedicated to everybody who knows what a single pixel is.
Its layout is not very different from the famous Deluxe Paint or Brilliance, so
it will be quite easy to handle it if you know at least one of these programs.
If you aren't used to the art of drawing with up to 256 colors, it will be a
little more difficult for you, but you should give it a try (or more, because
most of the power of this program won't show up on the first try). Then, you
might eventually like to draw the oldskool way !

Grafx2 was originally written for the MS-DOS operating system. The authors
then released the sourcecode and we've modified it to run on your favorite
platform (if we missed it, please tell us !). Check the homepage at
http://code.google.com/p/grafx2 for latest news and bugfixed versions.

If you are in trouble when using the program, don't forget you can always press
the <F1> key inside it to get some help. You can also check the wiki at
http://code.google.com/p/grafx2/wiki for some more information.
If you've hidden the menu and you're stuck, press <F10> to show it again.
