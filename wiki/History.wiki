HISTORY of GRAFX: (in chronological order: latest version at the end)

=GRAFX 1.0รก -> 1.02 (09/??/1995 -> 07/??/1996)=
Forget it!

=GRAFX 2.00 Beta 90% (11/01/1996) - Wired'96 release=
This version was 1st shown at the Wired'96 demo party in Belgium. We gave it to many people there, so let's start history from here. Note that there were a few different "90%" versions because we didn't want to change the number just for tiny bug-fixes.

=GRAFX 2.00 Beta 91% (11/20/1996)=
  * Fixed: Terrific bug in Help/Messages (one line was too long and crashed the program!).
  * Added: Some new parameters for the settings.
  * Added: Now, you can automatically set the best resolution for the picture loaded and/or slightly adapt the picture to keep the colors of the menu (for those who want to use GrafX2 as a viewer).
  * Fixed: Bug that occured when you wanted to restore your previous brush while being in "grab brush" mode.
  * Added: English user's manual written (will be updated later, and translated into French).
  * Fixed: No more displays pixels out of the preview window when loading corrupt pictures.
  * Fixed: Small bug in LBM loading (for non-standard widths).
  * Fixed: Minor error when saving the original screen dimensions in PKM files. (we didn't save words with Intel conventions)
  * Fixed: Exactly the same bug for LBM (but with Motorola conventions)
  * Removed: No more saving the current palette when exiting the program (that was useless and boring when pictures had a weird palette).

=GRAFX 2.00 Beta 92% (11/27/1996)=
  * Fixed/Removed: Error message occuring when accessing a drive with no disk or so finally suppressed!
  * Fixed: BMP loading was almost completely bugged and it should now be completely debugged.

  * Added: Backup (`*`.BAK) files.

=GRAFX 2.00 Beta 93% (12/12/1996)=
  * Fixed: Bug that occured when approaching the borders of the screen in grid mode with the type of cursor used for brush grabbing.
  * Fixed: Small but annoying bug when saving files with a name of 9 characters.

  * Imporoved: "Windows 95" keys are now usable.
  * Modified: We now use the EOS dos-extender Copyright (c) 1996 by Eclipse, so read carefully the docs if you can't use GrafX2 anymore.

=GRAFX 2.00 Beta 95% (07/18/1997) - Wired'97 release=
(It's GrafX2 creation's 1st anniversary! =D     (...but still Beta :/) We wrote the usual "void main(int argc, char * argv[])" one year ago!)
  * Fixed: PCX files with odd widths should be supported now. (We fixed a bug in version 94.1% which added a new one) :(

  * Fixed: File selector gauges don't bug any more when there are more than 584 entries :) in the current directory.
  * Fixed: The file selector _should_ hang no more on non-image (or corrupt image) files containing data that look like a known format signature.

  * Fixed: The mouse correction factors didn't work properly.
  * Added: Quick-shade mode.
  * Improved: You can hide any menu that needs a color selection to pick up a color behind the window.

  * Improved: The drawing mode is no more set to "discontinuous" by default.
  * Improved: The function to compute the best matching RGB color used in smooth, colorize, and some other operations has been strongly accelerated on 486 and Cyrix processors, while it should be about the same speed or very slightly slower on Intel Pentiums (II) than before.
  * Fixed: The program finally works under Windows NT (without dos4gw)!

=GRAFX 2.00 Beta 96.5% (12/23/1999) - Xmas'99 release=
  * Fixed: This version seems (is!) stable even with huge pictures. :)
  * Fixed: A few options on brushes kept modifying the continuity of the free-hand drawing mode.
  * Fixed: The "nibble brush" operation crashed sometimes.

  * Improved : Rewrote a big part of the program to make it work with SDL under linux, windows, mac os X, and amigaos4. This version will not run directly under good old MS-Dos, but it is still possible to use HX-DOS extender with the windows version.
  * Introduces a lot of new bugs, most notably missing refresh of screen.

=GRAFX 2.00 Beta 98.0% (01/??/2009)=
  * Added : palette constraint modes: Run the program with command-line option "/rgb <N>" to force RGB components have N levels instead of 256. Ex: /rgb 16 enforces a classic Amiga 4096 color palette, 64 is PC VGA, /rgb 3 is Amstrad CPC...) Added missing messages for /wide and /tall command-line arguments.
  * Improved : Use GIF as the default format, as PKM can't save the whole palette range.
  * Imroved : The buttons in the screens FX and Brush FX now use the same shortcuts as when drawing.
  * Fixed : The Spray tool no longer lags when you use a >0 delay setting. Delay is now expressed in 1/100s, with range 0-99
  * Fixed : a severe memory leak, up to 200Kb every time you closed a window.
  * Added : Simple joystick support.
  * Added : a listing of all the mountpoints under linux.
  * fixed : Sliders no longer lag the mouse cursor, and the delay stops when you release one mouse button or click the other.
  * Fixed : Endianess in Save_BMP
  * Fixed : screen updates problems
  * Fixed : keyboard-drawing in zoom area: "Escaping" the zoom window, and going up at the top warps to the bottom. Also, even with mouse,when you draw downwards into the menu, the cursor no longer blinks into the top line of the menu.
  * Improved : Cursor moves faster when using the keyboard shortcuts over the zoomed screen.
  * Fixed : some problems of sreen update in smear mode (issue 66) and possibly some others.
  * Fixed : a bug which attempted to refresh below the screen when menu is hidden
  * Fixed : Random crash and weird coordinates of viewports when resizing the screen (w/ and w/o zoom, with resolution change or window resize) 
  * Fixed : crash when using line,polyline,polygon etc. with a starting point below the picture (outside).
  * Fixed : issue 56: Window resizing and zoom mode. 
  * Fixed : issue 70: Keyboard shortcuts during brush rotation and stretch.
  * Improved : Allow sliders to scroll more than once when the mouse button is pressed
  * Fixed : broken characters >127 in the help window. Fix broken characters >127 in normal fonts.
  * Remove : useless setting "show system directories".
  * Fixed : wrong color selection in Spray menu when clicking between columnns
  * Added : Support for "wide pixel" mode (Each pixel is 2x1). Run the program with "/wide" argument to test. Now you can draw graphics for Amstrad CPC's "mode 0" :)	
  * Improved : Now idles when there is nothing to do. Much less CPUtime use, but the spray is slowed down.
  * Added : Support for "tall pixel" mode (Each pixel is 1x2). Run the program with "/tall" argument to test. The following tools don't take the ratio into account; Circle, Grad rectangle, Brush rotation, Resizable brushes (diamond, squares, circles...)
  * Improved : faster color reduction algorithm.
  * Fixed : "Backspace" shortcut detecting root only on MS filesystems in load/save screen.
  * Improved : On all screens that display a palette, the grey columns are no longer "dead", you can click them to pick the color to its right.
  * Fixed : display of colored rectangles in Palette screen (issue 64)
  * Fixed : wrong shortcuts in Palette screen Removed an obsolete message ("Sensibilite Souris") and dead code
  * Fixed : Floyd steinberg dithering. The error was added to the neighbour pixels, it is now substracted, the results are much better. However, the palette seems to lack saturated colors (in comparison to the one generated by gimp, wich gives more dithering, but better overall subjective ressemblance to the 24bit image.
  * Improved : Palette now uses RGB components in the full 0-255 range instead of 0-63. All palette functions can be used in HSL color space too.
  * Improved : directory handling: - Unix users can "make install" and "make uninstall" (as root). - Installation creates shortcuts "grafx2" and "gfx2cfg" in /usr/local/bin - Installation puts data files (icon GIFs, gfx2.dat,..) and the actual binaries in /usr/local/share/grafx2 - At runtime, the programs search and create configuration files (gfx2.cfg and gfx2.ini) in ~/.grafx2 (But if there are some present in program's own directory, they override)
  * Fixed : program hang in Save/Load (Issue 59)
  * Improved : Add 32 null bytes at end of PI1 files to make ST Deluxe Paint happy
  * Improved : Help screens show the keyboard shortcuts from current configuration
  * Fixed : long filenames, and cursor keys while editing text
  * Added : handling for right mouse button when entering filenames input array (clears it) also using escape key restores old filename.
  * Fixed : Clicking the button with default filename in an empty directory wouldn't work.
  * Fixed : crash in Save_PKM() which were due to the packing routine accessing a byte of a picture beyond the allocated memory block.
  * Fixed : the display of the current directory size if it is big.
  * Fixed : drawing with the keyboard. Space key release wasn't taken into account. Now you can plot a single pixel.
  * Added : Load/Save: "Select Drive" button. Allows a way for the AmigaOS4 version to display the list of drives / volume names.
  * Added : TEXT Tool with support for truetype and bitmap fonts.
  * Fixed : sprite cursor drawing on screen edges
  * Added : AmigaOS 3, BeOS, Haiku, AROS, SkyOS, MorphOS, gp2x support
  * Fixed : x-swap and swap
  * Added : Gradiation rectangle.
  * Added : support for 192:145 (1152*870) aspect ratio in screen sizes dialog (and revamped the column a bit).
