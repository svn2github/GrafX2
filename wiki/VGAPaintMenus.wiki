I've wrote down the menu scheme of VGA paint so we can easily look what is in it.
I've starred (*) features we don't have.

		640x480x16
		1x1x1 RGB
		640x480x2
	Process
		3x3 average rgb (each pixel is replaced by the average of the 8 pixels around. new palette is created for this) (*)
		5x5 average rgb (*)
		3x3 median rgb (*)
		invert
		color most > least (sort color by number of pixes using them) (*)
		color least > most (*)
		merge same colors
		pcx-optimize (sort palette to make pcx compression better) (*)
		delta horizontally (each pixel is replaced with his difference from the previous one. allow better compression.(*)
		delta vertically (*)
		un-delta horizontal (*)
		un-delta verticale (*)
	Pre-pics (draw something to the current page) (useful for quickly testing a palette ?) (*)
		Color chart
		RGB bars
		Rainbows (HSV)
		Plasma
		Gamma test
		Maze
		Default palette (convert current image to default ms-dos vga palette)
	Spare
		New (*)
		Swap
		Copy from spare
		Spare list (*)
		Get palette
		Fit to palette
		Merge
		Delete
		Underlay (color index 0 in current picture is replaced by corresponding pixel in spare) (*)
		Overlay (*)
	Tone (*) (no space left in our palette screen...)
		Brightness / Contrast / Gamma
		Color balance
		Color control
	Convert
		Greyscale
		Black&White
		Grey 256-level

		Stretch (from brush) (*)

		Horizontal (does nothing)
		Vertical (does nothing)
		Horiz gradient (*)
		Vert gradient (*)
		Color range (select gradient to use for horiz and vert grad mode)
	Draw mode
		Normal
		Range FWD
		Range back
		Color range (same as our shade window)
	Line mode
		Normal
		AA (always with the same color) (*)
		AA+blend (get AA color from existing pixels) (*)
	Blit mode
		Normal
		Transparent
		Add
	Tile mode (in zoom mode, instead of using colors you draw with 16x16 tiles from the spare page) (*)
Pref
	Video driver
	Capture mode (for capturing screens from other dos programs) (*) (look if that can be done... will be platform-specific for us however)
	Repeat draw (same as our feedback)
	Coords
	Aspect ratio (adjust circles so they look like circles in non-1:1 modes) (*)
	Autotransparency (if 4 corners of brush grab have the same color, select it as transaprent) (*)
	Adjust brush pick
	No-flicker brush
	Hires tools (technical option. we don't care)
	Hog CPU time (tech)
	Half screen (tech)
	Screen density (tech)
	Monitor adjust (simple gamma adjust creen) (*)
	Scroll mode (how to scroll when mouse is outside screen area. Not really relevant for us as in this case the window will become inactive) (*)
		Mouse mode (pan until cursor is on screen again)
		Tablet mode (pan until user move cursor out of screen border)
	Fast preview (apply effects after the stroke is finished so the prog runs faster. we already do it)
	Save settings (allows to save separately the preferences, video mode and pixcture size)
	Reduction mode (*)
		Max colors (we always do 256)
		Dither (we always do it)
