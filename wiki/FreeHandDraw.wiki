Selects the current hand-drawing mode as the active drawing tool. There are 3 hand-drawing modes:

 * Continuous hand-drawing: as you move the mouse, the paintbrush is regularily pasted on the picture. This drawing tool allows to change the fore and back colors when being in use.

 * Discontinuous hand-drawing: as you move the mouse, the paintbrush is pasted on the picture every time a delay is passed (the delay is fixed to 20ms). This drawing tool allows to change the fore and back colors when being in use.

 * Dot by dot hand-drawing: the paintbrush is only pasted at the position where you first clicked.


== Right click ==

Toggles the different hand-drawing modes and activates, at the same time, the hand-drawing tool.
