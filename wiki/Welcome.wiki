#summary Starting point of the wiki, to avoid putting the user in front of a random list of pages...

= Introduction =

Want to know more about this wonderful program ? This page will help you to find your way out of our messy documentation. Select a page in the list below and... happy reading !

= General Pages =

 * The [CurrentStatus current status]page says all and everything about what's done, what's left to do, and what we are doing in the project.


= User documentation =

 * The [UserManual user's manual] to learn how to use the program, from basic drawing to advanced tips and tricks.
 * The [FileFormats file formats matrix] shows you the picture formats Grafx2 can load and save, and also features a list of formats we plan to add in the next releases.
 * If you are used to the old DOS versions of Grafx2, then you should read [DifferencesWithDOSVersion this page] to see what changed since then.

= Developper documentation =

 * If you want to joint the project, you can start over by reading the [Compiling compiling notes]
 * There's some documentation on how to code according to the different [PlatformDependantCode platforms]
 * Grafx2 uses a custom picture format called [PKMSpec PKM]. Here are some informations about it.
 * The internals of the program are divided in many parts, however we have documentation only for the [InputInterface input interface], and the [OperationsEngine operations engine]. This should be enough if you want to add more tools to the program.
