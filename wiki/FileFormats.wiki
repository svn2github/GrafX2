#summary List of file formats that grafx2 can save and load

= Introduction =

Grafx2 under DOS has support for various file formats from other drawing tools. Each format's saving and loading routines have been rewritten to support the format on all platforms, with big-endian or little-endian CPU, and with no problems of byte alignment.
Here is a table showing the status of each format.

= Supported formats table =

|| *Extension* || *Save* || *Load* || *Misc* ||
|| [PKMSpec PKM] || Yes || Yes || Grafx2 own format  ||
|| LBM || Yes || Yes || Electronic arts ||
|| GIF || Yes|| Yes except animation || Compuserve GIF 89a. If several images are present (animation...) GrafX2 will load them as layers (up to 16), and discard the timing data. Only one palette is supported, so high-color tricks are not supported. 1-bit files (2 color) cannot be read. Saving is always in 8-bit mode (256 colors). On saving, if several layers are present, Grafx2 will make a non-looping animated GIF. Transparent color is supported in load and save.||
|| PNG || Yes || Yes || Portable Network Graphics. Reads all forms of paletted images (from 2 to 256 colors), greyscale (any depth, converted to a 256-level greyscale palette from black to white). Additional PNG information, like Alpha channel and Transparency are not preserved. The image description is read and saved as the 'Title' text, limited to 32 characters. Saving is always with 256-color palette. Palette transparency is supported, up to 1 color can be fully transparent. Saving is always in 8-bit mode (256 colors) ||
|| BMP || Yes || Most || Microsoft Paint. Some variants of Bitmaps cannot be loaded, neither by the original GrafX2 nor by our version. Saving is always in 8-bit mode (256 colors) ||
|| PCX || Yes || Yes || Z-Soft ||
|| IMG || Yes || Yes || Bivas (W. Wiedmann) ||
|| SC? || Yes || Yes || Colorix ||
|| [AtariFileFormats PI1] || Yes || Yes || Degas Elite ||
|| [AtariFileFormats PC1] || Yes || Yes || Degas Elite ||
|| CEL || Yes || Yes || K.O.S. (KISekae Set System) ||
|| KCF || Yes || Yes || K.O.S. (KISekae Set System) ||
|| [AtariFileFormats NEO] || Yes || Yes || Neochrome ||
|| PAL || Yes || Yes || Can load raw 768-bytes RGB palettes, as well as JASC Palette. Saving is always performed as JASC Palette ||
|| other || No || Yes || JPEG, TGA, truecolor PNG can be loaded thanks to the SDL_image library. This is not always possible on all platforms (ie. on linux if you compile SDL_image without PNG, you lose the PNG format.) Files that can be loaded this way have no preview in the fileselector. ||
If you find a file that grafx2 can't load, please send it to us so we can fix the broken code.
