#summary List of file formats that grafx2 can save and load

= Introduction =

Grafx2 under DOS has support for various file formats from other drawing tools. Each format's saving and loading routines have been rewritten to support the format on all platforms, with big-endian or little-endian CPU, and with no problems of byte alignment.
Here is a table showing the status of each format.
