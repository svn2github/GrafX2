#summary List of file formats that grafx2 can save and load

= Introduction =

Grafx2 under dos has support for various file formats from other drawing tools. However, in the code we have, this support is broken by structure alignment and padding problems, and is not endianess-aware. Each format's saving and loading routines should be rewritten to support the format correctly.
Here is a table showing the status of each format.
