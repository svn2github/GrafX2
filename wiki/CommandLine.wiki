#summary You can launch Grafx2 with some command line arguments.

= Introduction =

There are not many options, but they are quite useful

= List =

 * /? displays help (with a list of the availables videomodes)
 * /mode 320x200 starts grafx2 in 320x200 video mode.
 * /wide and /tall allow to use rectangle pixels (horizontal and vertical). This is useful to edit Amstrad CPC pictures, for example.
 * /rgb n sets the color depth to n. For example, /rgb 2 will give you a spectrum-style 16-colors palette, /rgb 3 will give the Amstrad CPC 27 colors, /rgb 16 will give a classical Amiga palette, and /rgb 64 will give you a VGA palette, like the DOS version of grafx2 had.
 * picture loads a picture.

For example :
 grafx2 /mode 320x200 My_drawing.pkm
