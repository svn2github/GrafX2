The project is quite useable, you can do basic drawing (lines, freehand, circles, rectangles). But there are many incomplete functions, for example the filling tool does not work, and all the special drawing modes (smear, shade, ...) are not implemented.
We have released a preview of the program so you can try it out and tell us if you find some bugs. Feel free to submit bug reports, or even better, some patches to the code.
