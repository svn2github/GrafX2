You can now use most functionalities of the program without any problems. There are still some bugs to fix up, like loading an ILBM file, and most of the palette operations (color reduction for example).
Please test the program and post bug reports if you run into some problem that is not already in our bugtracker !
Once we get all the bugs reported there fixed, we'll package an official release.
