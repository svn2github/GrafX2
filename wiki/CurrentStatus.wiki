= Status =

the project is compiling and running, but not useable yet. Many functions are still empty and doing nothing.
The main display primitives are working. We need to implement all the event handling (mouse and keyboard) to be able to use the program... Then we will have to translate all the remaining fiunctions from x86 to C.
