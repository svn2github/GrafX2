= Paintbrushes =

The active paintbrush is used for almost all drawing operations.

== Left click ==

Displays a menu where you can choose the shape of your paintbrush.

*TODO include a picture of the window*

Paintbrushes are sorted by family. You can see some paintbrushes of the same family but with different sizes. There is at least one paintbrush from each family displayed in this menu. Here is the list of all the different paintbrush families:

  * Square
  * Disc
  * Sieve square     
  * Sieve disc
  * Diamond
  * Random
  * Horizontal bar
  * Vertical bar
  * Slash
  * Backslash
  * Cross X
  * Cross +

The 3 last paintbrushes in the menu belong to the "miscellaneous" family and their size cannot be modified.

== Right click ==

Transforms your current user-defined brush into a paintbrush. This is actually a "monochromisation" of your user-defined brush. This means that every color of the brush that aren't the Back-color will be set to the Fore-color. But this option doesn't alter the brush: you'll just have to right-click on the "Get brush" buttons to get your brush back.

Note: When you press (not in the menu) the <Delete> key (default value), the current paintbrush becomes the smallest member of the "Disc" family, i.e one pixel.
