#summary List of useful issue tracker queries

= Introduction =

GrafX2 is a big project with a long history. We use the googlecode facility to keep track of _bugs_ and _feature requests_. On these pages, they are collectively called _Issues_.

To help you find your way, here are some useful lists. These shortcuts lead to specific queries, from there you'll be able to search for specific words or change the search parameters.

If you have a bug to declare, a feature to request, or some trouble using Grafx2 :
  # Please check that it's not already a known problem (do a text search on [http://code.google.com/p/grafx2/issues/list?can=1 All issues] page)
  # Have a look at the [FAQ]
  # and then use the [http://code.google.com/p/grafx2/issues/entry New issue] link.
