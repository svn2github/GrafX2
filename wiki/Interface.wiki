= Grafx2 user interface =

When you download the program, you get a zip file. The first thing to do is to extract it, as Grafx2 won't run from a compressed directory. Once you have done that, Grafx2's directory can be put anywhere on your hard disk. There is no setup process. If you want to stop using the program, it is as simple as deleting the folder and forgetting about it.
There are two executables in this directory : grafx2 and gfxcfg. gfxcfg allows you to customize all the key shortcuts. The default settings should work fine if you are a beginner, so, you don't have to run this one right now. The main program is the file called grafx2. Once you run it, a window will pop up and display the user interface with a welcome message. It will look like this :

As you can see, the screen is divided into various parts. At the bottom, there is a menubar with all the tools you can use. The top part is the drawing area. There you can use your mouse to draw things. On top of the drawing area, there is a window. You can notice that it does not look like regular windows from your operating system. This is because Grafx2 uses it's own system for drawing windows. It is possible to move this window by clicking on it's title bar and dragging it around, but you can't move it outside the main window of grafx2. You will have to get used to this way of drawing, as everything inside grafx2 is done like that.

From now on and to avoid confusions, we will use these words :
  * *Screen* is the main window of grafx2, including the menu and the drawing area. All windows are drawn in the screen.
  * *Window* is an internal window of grafx2, like the welcome window.
  * *Menu bar* is the bar at the bottom with all the icons.
  * *Drawing area* is the part of the screen that is not hidden by the menu.
  * *Picture area* is the part of the screen where you can actually draw. It is surrounded by white dashes. It may be bigger or smaller than the drawing area.
  * *status line* is the line of text at the bottom of the menu, displaying some info about what you are doing (usually the mouse coordinates)

Click anywhere on the screen to make the welcome window disapear. Let's start drawing some things.

= Interaction principles =

When you will use any drawing tool, left-clicking will draw with the Fore-color while right-clicking will draw with the Back-color.

When dialog boxes or windows will come on the screen, Cancel (or No) will always be emulated by the <Escape> key, and OK (or Yes) by the <Return> key.

In the different menus, the titles of the buttons that contain an underlined letter can be emulated by pressing this letter on the keyboard.

In some menus, you can select a color range in the palette. This means that you can click on a color and move the mouse to another by maintaining the button pressed to select a color range.
