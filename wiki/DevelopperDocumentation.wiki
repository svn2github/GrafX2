= Developper documentation =

 * If you want to joint the project, you can start over by reading the [Compiling compiling notes]
 * There's some documentation on how to code according to the different [PlatformDependantCode platforms]
 * Grafx2 uses a custom picture format called [PKMSpec PKM]. Here are some informations about it.
 * The internals of the program are divided in many parts, however we have documentation only for the [InputInterface input interface], and the [OperationsEngine operations engine]. This should be enough if you want to add more tools to the program.
